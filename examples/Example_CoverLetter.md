Acme Corp
Senior Security Engineer
https://example.com/jobs/123

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Security Engineer position at Acme Corp. With over 8 years of experience in penetration testing, red team operations, and security engineering, I am confident I can contribute meaningfully to your security team.

In my current role at SecureTech Consulting, I lead red team engagements for Fortune 500 clients, develop custom offensive tooling, and mentor junior team members. I have a strong track record of identifying critical vulnerabilities across web applications, cloud infrastructure, and enterprise networks. My experience aligns well with the technical requirements outlined in the job description, particularly in the areas of application security testing and cloud security assessments.

What draws me to Acme Corp is your commitment to building security into the product from the ground up. I am excited about the opportunity to apply my offensive security expertise to proactively identify and address security risks before they impact your customers.

I look forward to discussing how my experience and skills can benefit your team.

Sincerely,

Jane Doe
